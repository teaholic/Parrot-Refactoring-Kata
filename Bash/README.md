Parrot Refactoring Kata Bash version
====================================

This is a Bash port of the *Parrot Refactoring Kata*.

The project uses [Smoke](https://github.com/SamirTalwar/smoke) for running tests.
Smoke runs tests against anything, using command-line arguments, STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR.
